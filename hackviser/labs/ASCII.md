## Challenge

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and other devices that use text. This system primarily includes printable characters such as letters of English alphabet (upper and lower case), numbers, and punctuation marks. Each ASCII character is assigned a unique number between 0 and 127.

What is the decoded message of the text that has been encoded using ASCII inside the file?

File: `83 116 97 114 114 121 78 105 103 104 116 86 97 110 71 111 103 104`
